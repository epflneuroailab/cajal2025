# Cajal 2025 NeuroAI Course -- Schrimpf

System Models of Vision and Language in the Brain.

The aim of this tutorial is to make students comfortable in working with brain recordings, deep neural network models, and being able to compare the two.
We will use the Brain-Score platform to facilitate data and model loading.

Overview:
1. data
   2. loading, inspecting, visualizing
   2. analysis with linear probing
2. modeling
   1. compare pre-computed alexnet activations with RDM
   2. load brain-score model and compare with linear predictivity (one vision and one language example)
